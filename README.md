# Sweet Fruit

This is a sample website for a mexican artisan jams. The product is real, but the wbesite is not.

## Source code

You can read the source code by going to the src folder. The whole content of this page is created using JavaScript.

## Production bundle

The webpage you see deployed is located in the docs folder. It was created with webpack in order to maximize compatibility with old browsers (I use Babel) and minimize the final weight of the site.
